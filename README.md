The Bouncing Bunny Animation project features a cute bunny hopping across the screen. Using flexbox for alignment and keyframes for smooth movement, it's a great way to see how CSS can bring simple elements to life.

This project highlights the use of ease-in-out transitions to make the bunny's jumps feel natural and engaging. It's perfect for learning CSS animations or adding a fun touch to your projects.
